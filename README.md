# APx-CS3GD: Virtual MB204
Game project for CS3GD (Game Development) module.

## Backstory

The year is 20XX, and humanity has developed the technology for complete full-drive virtual reality. Anyone can use a special sleeping pod that will connect them to the virtual world. A group of passionate students took it upon themselves to recreate Aston University in the virtual world as their penultimate project. However, the university officials found the project to be a great opportunity to transition their teaching method to be virtual, like many other industries were doing, and integrated the project to be the official virtual reality of Aston University.

This project was not a one-to-one recreation. During the development, the students had taken many liberties and suggestions from their peers. The structure stayed mostly the same, but each area had a different theme, a different architectural ideal, and a different atmosphere to it.

You are a freshmen student at the newly redesigned virtual course of Aston University. Unfortunately, you are late to your presentation! Luckily, the virtual world run at an accelerated time, so you might make it in time if you can clear the levels leading to your destination.

# How to Play

**GOAL**: Reach virtual room MB204, which is located in Floor 2, Area B. It's especially marked on the map.

This is here in case I did not put the instructions inside the game.

- **Move**: WASD

- **Jump**: Space

- **Dash start**: Right mouse button. During dash PREP state, time is slowed down. Hold A/D for left/right, W/S for forward/backward, Space/Shift for up/down. Once you are holding the preferred direction, press < Right Mouse button > again to **DASH**!

- **Pause**: Esc

The timer on your top-left is your time point. In virtual Aston, time is slowed down by a factor of 10! However, if you gets deleted by touching some areas you should not touch, it takes 10s (of time point) to revive you, so be careful!

## For developers

Please, if you value your sanity, do not check the code. Do not awaken the Spaghetti Super Monster that lies within these areas. This is not a warning, this is a call for help.
